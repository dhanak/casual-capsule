## 📋 Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 24+ and Docker Compose v2
- Optionally rootless [podman](https://podman.io) 4.9+, to run the Capsule
  with a container engine of its own instead of the host daemon
  ([what it needs](#what-the-podman-backend-needs))
- Access to Claude or Codex.

Run [`capsule doctor`](#checking-your-environment) to check all of this and get
the command that repairs whatever is missing.

## 🚀 Initial setup

There is no true quick start for the first run. Capsule persists GitHub auth
state in the home volume, so it is worth doing setup in this order: prepare the
token first, then start Capsule, then verify the workspace and `gh` auth before
opening Claude or Codex. These checkpoints make later troubleshooting much
easier.

| Phase                | What it proves                                          |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Prepare credentials  | The first Capsule run can persist working GitHub auth.  |
| Start Capsule        | The image builds and the container starts successfully. |
| Verify the container | The workspace mount and persistent home volume work.    |
| Verify GitHub auth   | `gh` is already logged in before agent startup.         |
| Verify your agent    | Claude or Codex can read the workspace.                 |

### Phase 1: Prepare credentials

1.  Decide if you want to use Claude, Codex, or both.

2.  Generate a GitHub access token.

    1.  Open <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens>.

    2.  Make sure that you are logged in.

    3.  Click on the "Generate new token" button.

    4.  Confirm access if the UI asks you to do so.

    5.  Fill in the "New fine-grained personal access token" form:

        *   Token name: Choose any name. For example, "Capsule".

        *   Fill in the other fields as you see fit. It's ok to leave them on
            the default values.

    6.  Click on the "Generate token" button below the form.

    7.  Click on the "Generate token" button in the popup window.

    8.  Copy the token and save it somewhere safe.

    9.  You may close the GitHub website.

    The token only needs to cover `gh` and repository access. Capsule uses
    it for `gh` auth and as a build secret when `mise` downloads tools from
    GitHub. Claude and Codex authenticate separately, in Phases 5 and 6.

3.  Create a project directory that we can use as a test.

    ```
    $ mkdir /home/myuser/myproject
    $ cd /home/myuser/myproject
    $ echo "My favorite color is purple." > AGENTS.md
    $ echo "My favorite color is purple." > CLAUDE.md
    ```

4.  Add Capsule's `bin` directory to `PATH`:

    ```
    export PATH="/absolute/path/to/casual-capsule/bin:$PATH"
    ```

    You might want to add this to your init script (such as `~/.bashrc` or
    `~/.zshrc`). The existing `capsule.sh` entry point remains available for
    backward compatibility.

5.  Set `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` to the value you received from GitHub (replace
    `[GITHUB_API_TOKEN]`).

    Set this before the first build/run so the persistent home volume starts
    with working GitHub auth.

    ```
    $ export GITHUB_API_TOKEN=[GITHUB_API_TOKEN]
    ```

### Phase 2: Start Capsule

1.  Build the Capsule image, then start it in the current directory.

    ```
    $ capsule build
    $ capsule
    ```

2.  When Capsule asks the following, type `y`.

    ```
    Allow capsule to run in /home/myuser/myproject ([y]es/[N]no/[o]nly once)?
    ```

3.  You should see that Docker builds the Capsule image, creates a container and
    starts it:

    ```
    $ capsule build
    [...]
    [+] build 1/1
     ✔ Image hcs-capsule:local Built
    $ capsule
    Allow capsule to run in /home/myuser/myproject ([y]es/[N]no/[o]nly once)? y
    ✔ Volume casual-capsule_home Created
    Container casual-capsule-cli-run-4d7e2776d2fd Creating
    Container casual-capsule-cli-run-4d7e2776d2fd Created
    user@capsule:/home/workspace$
    ```

    **Checkpoint:** the base image built and Capsule started successfully.

### Phase 3: Verify the container

1.  Check your workspace:

    ```
    user@capsule:/home/workspace$ cat AGENTS.md
    My favorite color is purple.
    user@capsule:/home/workspace$ cat CLAUDE.md
    My favorite color is purple.
    ```

    Your `/home/myuser/myproject` directory is mounted to `/home/workspace`
    inside the container.

    **Checkpoint:** the workspace bind mount is correct before you start an
    agent.

2.  Check the user home directory:

    ```
    user@capsule:/home/workspace$ cat /home/user/.config/gh/hosts.yml
    github.com:
        users:
            myuser:
                oauth_token: [GITHUB_API_TOKEN]
        oauth_token: [GITHUB_API_TOKEN]
        user: myuser
    ```

    The Docker daemon created a `casual-capsule_home` Docker volume when it
    started the container. This volume is mounted to `/home/user`. This volume
    is persistent and shared between Capsule instances. Use `-p` or
    `--private-home` to bind-mount `~/.capsule-home` instead.

    The `/home/user/.config/gh/hosts.yml` file should contain your GitHub API
    token.

    **Checkpoint:** the persistent home volume contains the expected GitHub
    auth configuration.

### Phase 4: Verify GitHub auth

1.  Check that you are logged in to GitHub.

    ```
    user@capsule:/home/workspace$ gh auth status
    github.com
      ✓ Logged in to github.com account myuser (/home/user/.config/gh/hosts.yml)
      - Active account: true
      - Git operations protocol: https
      - Token: [GITHUB_API_TOKEN]
    ```

    **Checkpoint:** `gh` is ready before you open Claude or Codex.

    If `gh auth status` says that you are not logged in, add your GitHub token
    to `github_api_token.txt` (inside the container) and log in manually:

    ```
    $ gh auth login --with-token < github_api_token.txt
    ```

    You can do the same when your token expires in the future.

### Phase 5: Verify Claude (optional)

1.  Start Claude Code:

    ```
    $ claude
    ```

2.  Claude asks if you trust the files in `/home/workspace`.

    Choose the response that proceeds in this folder.

3.  Log in when Claude prompts you to.

    Claude prints a URL to open in your browser. Open it on the host,
    complete the login, and paste the resulting code back into the
    container.

    Credentials are written to `/home/user`, so the persistent home volume
    keeps you logged in across Capsule sessions.

4.  Test the connection and that Claude can read `CLAUDE.md`:

    ```
    > What is my favorite color?
    ● Your favorite color is purple.
    ```

### Phase 6: Verify Codex (optional)

1.  Start Codex:

    ```
    $ codex
    ```

2.  Select "Sign in with Device Code."

3.  Follow the instructions to log in.

4.  Codex asks if you trust `/home/workspace`.

    Choose the following response: "Yes, continue".

5.  Capsule automatically starts Codex with
    `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`. Codex therefore runs without
    approval prompts or its own sandbox and can access everything exposed to
    the Capsule, including a mounted host Docker socket.

6.  Test the connection and that Codex can read `AGENTS.md`:

    ```
    › What is my favorite color?
    • Your favorite color is purple.
    ```

## 💡 Usage

Once you set up Capsule, you can start it in any project directory. You can even
start Claude or Codex directly:

```
$ cd /home/myuser/myproject
$ capsule claude
$ capsule codex
```

## ⌨️ Capsule command examples

Pass a command instead of the default shell:

```bash
capsule claude
capsule run codex
capsule bash -lc "node -v && python --version"
capsule docker ps
```

Build without starting a Capsule:

```bash
capsule build
capsule build --no-cache
```

Build only a configured profile image:

```bash
capsule build --custom --profile /home/myuser/python-capsule
```

Build only a legacy custom Compose image:

```bash
CAPSULE_CUSTOM_COMPOSE=/home/myuser/python-capsule/compose.yml \
  capsule build --custom
```

The legacy `--build` and `--build-custom` run options remain available. They
build first, then start a Capsule.

Use `--` when arguments overlap launcher flags:

```bash
capsule -- --build true
```

## 🧩 Additional features

### Checking your environment

`capsule doctor` (or `capsule dr`) reports whether this host can run Capsule,
and names the fix for whatever it cannot:

```bash
capsule doctor
```

It covers both backends -- the Docker client, its compose plugin and daemon;
podman's rootless mode, sub-id range, systemd user scopes, delegated cgroup
controllers, OCI runtime and lingering, or the podman machine on macOS -- and
the linters this repository's own checks reach for.

A warning costs a capability and leaves the host usable. A failure means
something that looks available cannot actually run, and the command exits
non-zero on any failure, so a setup script can gate on it. Run it first
whenever `capsule` fails in a way that looks environmental.
Status labels use terminal colors when stdout is a color-capable terminal.
Set `NO_COLOR` to disable them.

### Shell completion

`capsule completion` generates completion definitions for Bash, Zsh, or Fish.
Profile completion offers configured profile names and local directories.
Install the generated file where your shell loads completions:

```bash
# Bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions
capsule completion bash \
  >~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/capsule

# Zsh; add ~/.local/share/zsh/site-functions to fpath if needed
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/zsh/site-functions
capsule completion zsh >~/.local/share/zsh/site-functions/_capsule

# Fish
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions
capsule completion fish >~/.config/fish/completions/capsule.fish
```

### Runtime backends: podman and Docker

Capsule can start its container two ways. The Docker backend runs
`docker compose run cli`, as it always has, and shares the host's Docker
daemon. The podman backend runs the same image as a rootless
[podman](https://podman.io) container that carries **its own container
engine**, so the chain becomes:

```
host -> podman -> capsule -> the Capsule's own engine -> your project
```

Both backends run the Capsule as a privileged container. The Docker backend
needs this so the rootless podman installed in the Capsule can run the
repository's podman tests; the podman backend needs it for its own nested
engine. On the Docker backend the entrypoint also assigns a complete
subordinate ID range, so nested builds can use standard system accounts such
as UID/GID 65534. The entrypoint still runs interactive commands as `user`.

That inner engine is private to the workspace the Capsule was started for. A
project brought up inside a Capsule cannot see the host's containers or
another workspace's, and `docker compose up` on a real stack behaves the way
it does on the host.

Capsule picks the backend on its own, and `--runtime` or `CAPSULE_RUNTIME`
decides it for you:

```bash
capsule --runtime podman           # run the Capsule as a rootless container
capsule --runtime docker           # keep using docker compose
CAPSULE_RUNTIME=podman capsule     # the same choice, from the environment
```

#### What the podman backend needs

*   **Rootless podman**, which is how it runs by default. Capsule refuses a
    rootful podman rather than run your Capsule as real root.

*   **A sub-id range** for your account, from the `uidmap` package. podman
    reports it as a second entry in its id map; without one it cannot even
    unpack an image that chowns a file. Capsule reads the same report and
    falls back to the Docker backend, naming the reason.

*   **A reachable systemd user bus** on Linux, because rootless podman asks
    your own `systemd --user` manager to create a cgroup scope for every
    container. Without it the runtime falls back to the system manager,
    polkit refuses the request, and nothing starts.
    [How to check and fix it](#when-podman-cannot-start-a-container).

*   **A Linux VM on macOS**, which podman manages itself (`podman machine
    init && podman machine start`). The workspace must live under `$HOME`
    for the machine to see it.

Unlike the Docker backend, no AppArmor or sysctl change is needed on Ubuntu
23.10+: podman's rootless path works there as shipped.

#### When podman cannot start a container

A build or run that dies with `Interactive authentication required`, on a
scope request naming `system.slice` rather than `user.slice`, means the
runtime could not reach your systemd user manager. `crun` reports the same
condition differently, as `sd-bus call: Process org.freedesktop.systemd1
exited with status 1`: it reached a session bus that has no systemd on it and
tried to activate one. One command settles either, run in the same shell
where Capsule failed:

```bash
busctl --user call org.freedesktop.systemd1 /org/freedesktop/systemd1 \
  org.freedesktop.DBus.Peer Ping
```

That asks the session bus for systemd the way the container runtime does. Do
not trust `systemctl --user` or `systemd-run --user` here: both reach the
user manager through `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/systemd/private` rather than through
the bus, so they answer happily while the bus itself is wrong.

If the probe fails, podman fails the same way, and the cause is one of the
three pieces that have to line up:
`pam_systemd` gives a login session `/run/user/$(id -u)` and a
`user@$(id -u).service` manager; the `dbus-user-session` package puts the
bus at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/bus`; and clients use `$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`
when it is set, falling back to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/bus` when it is not. A
*wrong* address is therefore worse than none, because it overrides the
working default.

*   **On a desktop login**, a session without `dbus-user-session` falls back
    to `dbus-launch`, which puts a private bus in `/tmp/dbus-XXXXXX` and
    exports its address. systemd is not on that bus. Install the package,
    then log out of the desktop completely: a new terminal inherits the
    stale address from the session that spawned it.

*   **Over SSH**, `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` is normally unset and the
    fallback does the right thing, so the causes are the package missing, or
    a stale address arriving from a shell startup file or from a terminal
    multiplexer that was started on the desktop. Grep your dotfiles for
    `dbus-launch`, and run `tmux kill-server` so new panes stop inheriting
    the old environment.

*   **`su` and `sudo -u` create no login session**, so that account gets no
    `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` and no user manager at all. Use `ssh` or
    `machinectl shell user@` instead.

Enable lingering as well, so the user manager and `/run/user/$(id -u)`
outlive your last session rather than taking a running Capsule with them:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

If you would rather not depend on a session bus at all -- a headless
builder, cron, CI -- take systemd out of the path instead. Rootless resource
limits become advisory rather than enforced, which does not affect building
or running the Capsule itself:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/containers
cat >> ~/.config/containers/containers.conf <<'EOF'
[engine]
cgroup_manager = "cgroupfs"
EOF
```

Once the bus works, a container that still dies on `unable to get oom kill
count` has a cgroup problem rather than a bus problem. systemd has to
delegate the `memory` controller to your user manager:

```bash
cd "/sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/user-$(id -u).slice"
cat "user@$(id -u).service/cgroup.controllers"
```

`memory` has to appear in that list. When it does not, delegate it and log
in again:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/user@.service.d
printf '[Service]\nDelegate=cpu cpuset io memory pids\n' |
  sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/user@.service.d/delegate.conf
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

If the controller is delegated and containers still refuse to start, the OCI
runtime is what is left. Recent `runc` releases turn a missing
`memory.events` into a fatal error where `crun`, the runtime podman prefers,
carries on. Install it, confirm it, then pin it:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y crun
podman --runtime crun run --rm alpine:3.20 echo ok
```

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/containers
cat >> ~/.config/containers/containers.conf <<'EOF'
[engine]
runtime = "crun"
EOF
```

#### The Capsule's own engine

Inside a podman Capsule, `docker` is served by an engine of the Capsule's
own, and nothing runs until the first container command:

```
user@capsule:/home/workspace$ docker ps
capsule: starting podman API socket (first use)...
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE   COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS   PORTS   NAMES
```

That default engine is podman answering the **Docker API**, so the `docker`
CLI and `docker compose` drive it with no daemon at rest. Projects that need
a true Docker Engine switch to one, and the choice then sticks for the life
of the Capsule:

```
user@capsule:/home/workspace$ capsule-docker use-dockerd
capsule: starting docker daemon (first use)...
capsule: engine: dockerd
user@capsule:/home/workspace$ capsule-docker status
engine: dockerd
podman api socket: stopped
dockerd: running
```

`capsule-docker use-podman` switches back and `capsule-docker stop` stops
whatever the Capsule started. The real Engine is only present when the image
was built with `CAPSULE_WITH_DOCKERD=1`, because it is the heavier of the
two; the router says so if it is missing.

#### What differs inside a podman Capsule

*   **You are still `user`, and your files are still yours.** podman's
    `keep-id` mapping puts your host account on the image's `user`, so
    everything written in `/home/workspace` belongs to you on the host and
    no UID/GID sync or privilege drop is needed.

*   **The inner engine's storage is per workspace.** Images, volumes and
    containers live in a volume keyed to the workspace path and mounted at
    `/var/lib/capsule/inner`, so two projects never share an image cache or
    see each other's containers. `CAPSULE_INNER_VOLUME` overrides the name.

*   **The host's Docker daemon is out of reach unless you ask for it.**
    `--host-docker` binds the host socket into the Capsule for the cases
    where you deliberately want it; without the flag the Capsule only has
    its own engine.

*   **Publishing a port takes two hops.** The project publishes to the
    Capsule, and `capsule --publish` publishes the Capsule to the host, so
    a service on 8080 wants `capsule --publish 8080:8080` as well as the
    usual `ports:` entry in the project's compose file.

*   **The outer podman container is `--privileged`.** A nested engine has to
    mount a proc and stack image layers. Rootless, that grants only what your
    own account already has: the Capsule still cannot exceed you on the host.

*   **`--remote` and custom compose files need a Docker daemon**, so those
    invocations use the Docker backend and say so.

### Listing running Capsules

Use `capsule list` to query running Capsules without starting one:

```bash
capsule list
capsule list --runtime docker
capsule list --runtime podman
```

The default `auto` selection queries Docker's configured endpoint and local
podman. The output includes the runtime, host user, container ID and name,
uptime, image, status, published ports, and host workspace directory.

When `DOCKER_HOST`, `DOCKER_CONTEXT`, or the active Docker context selects a
non-local endpoint, the target column shows that endpoint. Capsule leaves its
recorded UID numeric because the local account database does not describe the
daemon host. Use `--remote` for an SSH target whose user should be resolved.

Capsule recognizes containers through their `CAPSULE_HOST_WORKDIR`
environment variable. It resolves the recorded `CAPSULE_UID` against the
daemon host's account database. An unresolved UID is shown numerically;
missing UID metadata is shown as `unknown`.

Query a remote Docker host with the same SSH endpoint syntax used for runs,
but without a workspace path or allowlist approval:

```bash
capsule list --remote buildbox
capsule list --remote buildbox:2222
```

Remote listing uses Docker. A full run target such as
`buildbox:/srv/project` is also accepted and still lists every running
Capsule visible to that Docker daemon.

### UID and GID detection

Capsule auto-detects the host user's UID/GID via `id -u`/`id -g` and
`DOCKER_GID` from the active Docker socket (falling back to `991` on macOS,
`999` on Linux). If UID/GID detection fails (e.g. `id` is unavailable), it falls
back to `1000:100` and prints a warning. The entrypoint handles UID/GID
adjustment and Docker socket group membership at startup.

This mechanism ensures that the user inside the container can access the
`/home/workspace` directory and the host's Docker daemon.

You can override UID/GID or DOCKER_GID by using environment variables:

```bash
CAPSULE_UID=2000 CAPSULE_GID=2000 capsule
```

Bake a custom UID/GID into the image (avoids runtime `chown`):

```bash
CAPSULE_UID=2000 CAPSULE_GID=2000 capsule build
```

### Directory approval list


On the first run in a new directory, `capsule` prompts for explicit approval
and records the approved path in
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/capsule/approved-directories`
(overridable via `CAPSULE_CONFIG`) when you answer `y`. Answer `o` to allow
only the current run without updating the approval file. The default answer
is `N`. XDG base-directory variables used by Capsule must be absolute paths.

When `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset and the old `~/.config/capsule` approval file
exists, Capsule moves it to the new default location automatically and resumes
an interrupted migration on the next run. Symlinks are not migrated
automatically: replace the symlink with a regular file containing the approval
list, then retry.

When a remote run is active, Capsule checks only the remote target in that
same allowlist. Remote targets approved via `--remote` are stored as
`ssh://HOST[:PORT]/path`.

### Private home bind mount

Use `-p` or `--private-home` to replace the shared Docker volume for
`/home/user` with a bind mount from `~/.capsule-home` on the Docker daemon
host.

```bash
capsule --private-home
capsule -p --build
capsule -p -r buildbox:/srv/casual-capsule
```

This keeps Capsule state per user instead of per Docker Compose project.
When `--remote` is active, Capsule resolves `~/.capsule-home` on the remote
host. When `CAPSULE_HOST_PATH_MAP` is active inside a non-Capsule container,
Capsule resolves `~/.capsule-home` through that map; if the map does not cover
`$HOME`, set `CAPSULE_HOME_HOST_DIR` explicitly.

### Capsule profiles

Profiles are the preferred way to customize a Capsule. They work with both
Docker and Podman. A profile is a directory containing `capsule.toml` and any
files used by its optional Dockerfile fragment:

```toml
version = 1
name = "python"
volume = ["./config:/home/user/.config/example:ro"]
publish = ["8080:8080"]

[env]
PYTHON_CAPSULE = "1"
FORWARDED_TOKEN = "${SOURCE_TOKEN}"

[dockerfile]
content = '''
RUN uv tool install black
COPY --from=python config/ /opt/python-capsule/config/
'''
```

Apply and build it with the same ordered, repeatable option:

```bash
capsule build --profile /home/myuser/python-capsule
capsule --profile /home/myuser/python-capsule
capsule --profile /profiles/tools --profile /profiles/project
```

For reusable profiles, create
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/capsule/profiles/NAME/capsule.toml`.
Both `--profile` and `CAPSULE_PROFILES` accept `NAME`. Bare values always name
a profile. Capsule checks the user profile directory first, then profiles
shipped with Capsule. Use an explicit path such as `./python` to select a
directory relative to the current working directory.

`CAPSULE_PROFILES` is the environment equivalent. Separate profile names or
directory paths with semicolons:

```bash
CAPSULE_PROFILES="tools;/profiles/project" capsule
```

Selecting the same canonical profile directory more than once emits a warning
and applies it only once. Distinct profiles must still have unique names.

Relative volume sources resolve from the profile directory. Before a bind
mount reaches Docker or Podman, Capsule applies its normal host-path mapping,
including `CAPSULE_HOST_PATH_MAP` for nested Capsules. A profile Dockerfile
fragment uses `COPY --from=PROFILE_NAME` to read its directory as a named
build context.

Remote runs reject relative profile volume sources. Use `~` or an absolute
path on the remote daemon host.

Generated Dockerfiles and Compose overrides are cached under
`${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/capsule/profiles`.

A profile with `[dockerfile].content` runs only from the image built for that
exact ordered profile set. If the image is absent, Capsule stops before
container creation and prints the required `capsule build --profile` command.

The repository includes an NVIDIA profile:

```bash
capsule --profile nvidia
```

#### Migrating a custom Compose file

Move backend-neutral `cli` customization into `capsule.toml`:

| Compose or Dockerfile setting            | Profile setting        |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Dockerfile after its initial `FROM`      | `[dockerfile].content` |
| `environment`                            | `[env]`                |
| `volumes`                                | `volume`               |
| `ports`                                  | `publish`              |
| `extra_hosts`                            | `host`                 |
| NVIDIA runtime                           | `gpu = "all"`          |
| Compose project or home-volume isolation | `namespace`            |

Remove `FROM` from the old Dockerfile and place the remaining instructions in
`[dockerfile].content`. Change local `COPY` instructions to named-context
copies such as `COPY --from=python source/ /destination/`. Then replace
`CAPSULE_CUSTOM_COMPOSE=/path/compose.yml` with
`CAPSULE_PROFILES=/path/to/profile`.

Keep a custom Compose file when the customization needs sidecars, custom
networks, service dependencies, or arbitrary Compose keys. Profiles and
`CAPSULE_CUSTOM_COMPOSE` cannot be combined in one invocation.

### Custom Capsule images

Legacy custom Compose overrides remain supported for Docker-only
customization that a profile cannot express. Create a custom `compose.yml`
file and set its path in `CAPSULE_CUSTOM_COMPOSE`.

The custom `compose.yml` file must override the `cli` section.

Example layout:

```text
/home/myuser/python-capsule/
|- Dockerfile
`- compose.yml
```

Example `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM casual-capsule-cli:latest

RUN uv tool install black
```

Example `compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  cli:
    image: python-capsule:local
    build:
      context: ${CAPSULE_CUSTOM_DIR}
      dockerfile: ${CAPSULE_CUSTOM_DIR}/Dockerfile
    environment:
      PYTHON_CAPSULE: "1"
```

Use it like this:

```bash
export CAPSULE_CUSTOM_COMPOSE=/home/myuser/python-capsule/compose.yml
capsule build
```

With a custom compose file, `capsule build` first rebuilds the base image
`casual-capsule-cli:latest`, then builds the merged custom `cli` image. Start
the container with `capsule` afterward.

If you only want to rebuild the merged custom `cli` image, use
`capsule build --custom` instead. The legacy `--build` and `--build-custom`
run options still build and start in one invocation.

### Updating your GitHub token

The entrypoint reads the `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` secret on every container
start and calls `gh auth login --with-token` automatically.  To rotate
your token:

1. Export the new token in your shell:

   ```bash
   export GITHUB_API_TOKEN=ghp_...
   ```

2. Start a new Capsule session — the entrypoint handles the rest:

   ```bash
   capsule
   ```

The updated credentials are written to the persistent home volume and
survive subsequent restarts.  No rebuild is required.

### Port publishing

Use `--publish` to expose a port from the Capsule container on the Docker
daemon host.

```bash
capsule --publish 8080:8080
capsule --publish 8080:8080 --publish 127.0.0.1:9229:9229
```

Use `CAPSULE_PUBLISH` for repeatable port mappings in environment-based
launchers. Separate mappings with semicolons.

```bash
CAPSULE_PUBLISH="8080:8080;127.0.0.1:9229:9229" capsule
```

### Runtime volume mounts

Use `--volume` or `-v` to add extra bind mounts to the Capsule container. The
mount specification follows Docker's `HOST:CONTAINER[:OPTIONS]` syntax.

```bash
capsule --volume /host/cache:/cache
capsule --volume /host/config:/etc/config:ro
capsule -v /host/data:/data -v /host/cache:/cache
```

Use `CAPSULE_VOLUME` for repeatable mounts in environment-based launchers.
Separate mount specs with semicolons.

```bash
CAPSULE_VOLUME="/host/data:/data;/host/config:/etc/config:ro" capsule
```

### Bind mounts in containers started in a Capsule

When `capsule` runs inside an existing container, the path it sees may not
be a path the Docker daemon can mount. Capsule translates the current container
path back to the daemon-host path before asking Docker to create the
`/home/workspace` bind mount.

Inside a Capsule, do not reset `CAPSULE_HOST_WORKDIR`. The outer Capsule sets
it to the daemon-host workspace root, and nested launches reuse it
automatically when they use Docker. When a nested launch selects local podman,
Capsule automatically uses the current container path instead. Use
`CAPSULE_HOST_PATH_MAP` only when the current non-Capsule container sees the
same files under a different absolute path.

```bash
CAPSULE_HOST_PATH_MAP=/workspace=/home/myuser/myproject capsule
CAPSULE_HOST_PATH_MAP=/workspace=/src/project:/tmp/cache=/var/cache capsule
```

`CAPSULE_HOST_PATH_MAP` is a colon-separated list of
`container_prefix=host_prefix` pairs. The first matching prefix wins.

### Remote Docker host

Use `--remote HOST[:PORT]:/abs/path` to build and run on a remote Docker daemon
over SSH. Capsule sets `DOCKER_HOST=ssh://HOST[:PORT]` for Compose and mounts
`/abs/path` as `/home/workspace` on the remote daemon host.

```bash
capsule --remote buildbox:/srv/casual-capsule
capsule --remote buildbox:2222:/srv/casual-capsule
capsule --remote buildbox:/srv/casual-capsule --build
capsule build --remote buildbox
capsule list --remote buildbox
```

Remote run targets must be approved first. Build and read-only `list` queries
do not need approval. Use an SSH config host alias when you need extra SSH
options beyond the optional port in `HOST[:PORT]`.

## 🔧 Configuration reference

### Command line options

Usage:

```
capsule [run] [RUN_OPTIONS] [--] [COMMAND...]
capsule build [BUILD_OPTIONS]
capsule list [LIST_OPTIONS]
capsule doctor
capsule completion bash|zsh|fish
```

Omitting the subcommand selects `run` for backward compatibility. Use an
explicit `run` when the container command has the same name as a Capsule
subcommand, for example `capsule run build`.

Run options:

*   `-b`, `--build`: Build the base image and configured profile or legacy
    custom image before `run`.

*   `-p`, `--private-home`: Bind-mount `~/.capsule-home` from the Docker daemon
    host to `/home/user` in the container.

*   `--build-custom`: Build only the configured profile image or merged legacy
    custom Compose image before `run`.

*   `--profile NAME|PATH`: Apply a Capsule profile. May be passed multiple
    times; order controls Dockerfile fragment and runtime-setting order.

*   `-r HOST[:PORT]:/abs/path`, `--remote HOST[:PORT]:/abs/path`: Run
    `docker compose` against `ssh://HOST[:PORT]` and mount `/abs/path` as
    `/home/workspace` on that remote host.

*   `--runtime podman|docker|auto`: Choose the backend that runs the Capsule.
    `auto`, the default, prefers podman and falls back to Docker with the
    reason named.

*   `--host-docker`: Bind the host's Docker socket into the Capsule. Only
    meaningful on the podman backend, which is otherwise isolated from it.

*   `--publish HOST[:CONTAINER]`: Publish a container port on the host when
    running the container. May be passed multiple times.

*   `-v HOST:CONTAINER[:OPTIONS]`, `--volume HOST:CONTAINER[:OPTIONS]`:
    Bind-mount a host path into the runtime container. May be passed multiple
    times. For example, use `:ro` for a read-only mount.

*   `--no-cache`: Pass `--no-cache` to the build commands triggered by
    `--build` or `--build-custom`.

*   `-h`, `--help`: Show usage message.

*   `--`: Stop launcher option parsing; pass remaining arguments to
    `docker compose run cli`.

Build options:

*   `--all`: Build the base image and configured profile or legacy custom
    Compose image. This is the default.

*   `--custom`: Build only the configured profile image or merged legacy
    custom Compose image.

*   `--profile NAME|PATH`: Apply a Capsule profile. May be passed multiple
    times.

*   `--no-cache`: Disable the build cache.

*   `-r`, `--remote HOST[:PORT]`: Build on a remote Docker host.

*   `--runtime podman|docker|auto`: Select the build backend.

List options:

*   `-r`, `--remote HOST[:PORT]`: Query a remote Docker host. A workdir suffix
    is accepted but ignored.

*   `--runtime podman|docker|auto`: Select local runtimes to query. `auto`
    queries both.

Other subcommands:

*   `doctor`, `dr`: Check host runtime support and name repairs.

*   `completion bash|zsh|fish`: Generate shell completion definitions.

### Environment variables

Boolean options accept `1`, `true`, `yes`, or `on`. They are disabled by an
empty value, `0`, `false`, `no`, or `off`.

*   `CAPSULE_BUILD`: Enable the run command's `--build` option.

    Default: empty.

*   `CAPSULE_BUILD_CUSTOM`: Enable the run command's `--build-custom` option.

    Default: empty.

*   `CAPSULE_NO_CACHE`: Enable `--no-cache` for builds.

    Default: empty.

*   `CAPSULE_PRIVATE_HOME`: Enable `--private-home`.

    Default: empty.

*   `CAPSULE_PROFILES`: Semicolon-separated profile names or directory paths.
    Environment profiles apply before command-line `--profile` options.

    Default: empty.

*   `CAPSULE_REMOTE`: Remote target. Run requires
    `HOST[:PORT]:/absolute/workdir`; build and list accept `HOST[:PORT]`.

    Default: empty.

*   `CAPSULE_HOST_DOCKER`: Enable `--host-docker`.

    Default: empty.

*   `CAPSULE_RUNTIME`: Backend used by run, build, or list: `auto`, `podman`,
    or `docker`.

    Default: `auto`, which prefers podman when the host can run it rootless.

*   `CAPSULE_IMAGE`: Image tag the podman backend builds and runs.

    Default: `casual-capsule:local`. Set it to run a prebuilt image, which
    also turns off the "image is not built" check.

    A prebuilt image must have been built with the same
    `CAPSULE_UID`/`CAPSULE_GID` as the host account, because keep-id
    maps you onto that uid and nothing inside can adjust it.

*   `CAPSULE_HOME_VOLUME`: podman volume mounted at `/home/user`.

    Default: `casual-capsule-home`. Ignored under `--private-home`.

*   `CAPSULE_INNER_VOLUME`: Volume holding the inner engine's images,
    volumes and containers.

    Default: derived from the workspace path, so each project gets its own.

*   `CAPSULE_WITH_DOCKERD`: Build the image with a real Docker Engine.

    Default: empty. Set to `1` at build time to make `capsule-docker
    use-dockerd` available inside the Capsule.

*   `CAPSULE_DEBUG`: Enable shell xtrace for `capsule`.

    Default: empty. When set to `1`, Capsule runs with `set -x`.

*   `CAPSULE_UID`: Container user UID (user ID).

    Default: The output of `id -u` on the host. If that doesn't work, then 1000.

*   `CAPSULE_GID`: Container user GID (group ID).

    Default: The output of `id -g` on the host. If that doesn't work, then 100.

*   `DOCKER_GID`: Docker socket GID.

    Default: Auto-detected from the host.

*   `DOCKER_HOST`: Docker daemon endpoint for `docker compose`.

    Default: Docker CLI default. `--remote` sets `ssh://HOST[:PORT]`.

*   `CAPSULE_HOME_HOST_DIR`: Host path bound to `/home/user` when
    `--private-home` is active.

    Default: empty. `--private-home` resolves it to `~/.capsule-home` on the
    Docker daemon host, using `CAPSULE_HOST_PATH_MAP` when needed.

*   `CAPSULE_HOST_PATH_MAP`: Colon-separated
    `container_prefix=host_prefix` mappings for resolving daemon-host paths
    from inside non-Capsule containers.

    Default: empty. The first matching prefix wins, and the mapped host path is
    used for allowlist checks.

*   `CAPSULE_PUBLISH`: Semicolon-separated list of `--publish` specs.

    Default: empty. Each non-empty entry is passed before command-line
    `--publish` options.

*   `CAPSULE_VOLUME`: Semicolon-separated list of
    `HOST:CONTAINER[:OPTIONS]` `--volume` specs.

    Default: empty. Each non-empty entry is passed before command-line
    `--volume` options.

*   `CAPSULE_WORKDIR`: Workspace directory.

    Default: current working directory.

*   `CAPSULE_CUSTOM_COMPOSE`: Optional legacy custom Compose override file.
    It cannot be combined with `CAPSULE_PROFILES` or `--profile`.

    Default: empty.

*   `CAPSULE_CONFIG`: Path to the file that contains the approved directories.

    Default:
    `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/capsule/approved-directories`.

*   `CAPSULE_HOST_WORKDIR`: daemon-host-visible path for `/home/workspace`.

    Default: derived from `CAPSULE_WORKDIR`. `--remote` overrides it with the
    remote workspace path.

*   `GITHUB_API_TOKEN`: Passed as a build secret for `gh` auth and for `mise`
    tool downloads from GitHub.

    Podman stages its per-run secret under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/capsule`.
    Without that directory, it uses
    `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/capsule/runtime`. On macOS it always uses
    `$HOME/.cache/capsule/runtime`, which the Podman machine can access.

## 🧪 Run checks and tests

Run lint checks on the host:

```bash
$ make check
```

Run the test suites on the host:

```bash
$ make test
```

Run `make help` to list the available targets. The scripts under `tests/`
remain directly executable.

The podman backend is covered by the fast suite -- a mocked `podman` for the
launcher, mocked engines for the in-Capsule router -- and by an end-to-end
case that skips unless the host can run rootless containers. To exercise the
whole chain on a real host, a Capsule with its own engine and a service
running inside it, use the untracked operator check:

```bash
$ tmp/verify-podman-backend.sh
```

Run checks and tests inside a Capsule:

```bash
$ capsule tests/check_all.sh
$ capsule tests/test_all.sh
```

`check_all.sh` runs `dclint`, `hadolint`, and `shellcheck` on discovered files.
When one of these tools is missing, it prints a warning and skips that linter.

`test_all.sh` prints each suite name before running it.

*   The fast suite uses command stubs, so it does not require a running Docker
    daemon.

*   The end-to-end suite builds and runs the real capsule image when Docker and
    Compose are available. It skips cleanly when the daemon is unavailable.

    The end-to-end suite also prints the path to a per-run logfile under
    `_build/tests/`. The logfile is kept after the run and records suite events
    and plain Docker/Capsule output with UTC timestamps on every line.

## 🤖 Included agent tooling

The image includes utilities commonly used by coding agents, installed via
`mise` (configured by the `MISE_SYSTEM_TOOLS` Dockerfile ARG). Set
`MISE_SYSTEM_TOOLS` in the build environment to override the default tool list
when building through Compose. This replaces the entire default list. Existing
overrides must add `python@<version>`, `ruff`, and `ty` to retain the Python
tooling now included in that list. Include `codex`; its wrapper is configured
during the build.

```bash
MISE_SYSTEM_TOOLS="bat codex fd jq python@3.14 ripgrep ruff ty uv" \
  docker compose build cli
```

- `claude`: Claude Code agent CLI.
- `codex`: Codex agent CLI, always started without approvals or sandboxing.
- `bat`: Syntax-highlighted file viewing.
- `eza`: Enhanced directory listing.
- `fd`: Fast file discovery.
- `gh`: GitHub CLI operations.
- `jq`: JSON filtering and inspection.
- `rg` (`ripgrep`): Fast content search.
- `uv`: Python version, tool, and environment management.

Container engines (see
[Runtime backends](#runtime-backends-podman-and-docker)):

- `podman`: The Capsule's own rootless engine, which also answers the Docker
  API so `docker` and `docker compose` work against it.
- `dockerd`: A real Docker Engine, present only when the image is built with
  `CAPSULE_WITH_DOCKERD=1`.
- `capsule-docker`: Selects which of the two `docker` talks to.

Installed via `apt`:

- `shellcheck`: Shell script linting.
- `tree`: Directory structure visualization.

Python tooling (installed as system `mise` tools and available on `PATH` via
`/usr/local/share/mise/shims`; include these tools in any
`MISE_SYSTEM_TOOLS` override):

- `python`: Python runtime (version set by `PYTHON_VERSION` ARG, default
  `3.14`).
- `ruff`: Fast Python linter and formatter.
- `ty`: Python type checker.

Verify inside capsule:

```bash
capsule bash -lc "rg --version && fd --version && jq --version && \
  bat --version && eza --version && shellcheck --version && \
  gh --version && tree --version && python --version"
```

## 🔐 Security Note

The Docker backend runs the Capsule as a privileged container and mounts the
host Docker socket at `/var/lib/capsule/docker.sock`. Either capability can
provide host-level access. Do not use this setup with untrusted code or on
shared hosts.
